        "question": "How Do We Communicate?",
        "answer": "We’ll usually have an initial chat on the phone, Skype, Meet or Zoom to discuss the project. Once we get started, most of the communication will take place over email, clickup or slack. This makes the process a lot easier as we’ll have all of the information saved and can come back to it later. Once we’ve finished the project, we will book you in our training sessions or your team. It’s rare that we NEED to meet people face to face. Technology allows us to do so much in a small space of time so we don’t believe face to face meetings are necessary. We are always happy to meet you in person if you really need us to but we’ll arrange a consultation price for travel and possible accommodation. depending on the distance."
